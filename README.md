# transfer_learning_cnn

Sample code and explanation of the convolutional neural networks(CNN). Basically how the kernels/filters evolved from being hard-coded to being learnable parameters. Also included in
the papers is a brief history about the development of CNN architecture from basics to the SOTA ResNet(Residual Network) along with some variants. The explanations includes the convolution,
padding,strides,parameter calculations,pooling and fully connected layers for the architechtures mentioned in the paper.
